## Overview
This is a simple project to explore the Decision Tree Classifier from the sklearn library.
The goal of this project doesn't consist in Exploratory Data Analysis or Data Cleaning, but in learning and using the Decision Tree Classifier.

## Business Understanding
When clients request a loan, sometimes it isn't fully paid and that is a risk for the company providing the service. It is fundamental to identify the potential clients that are at risk of not paying the full amount.

## The Challenge
Mitigating the risk described above we can make use of machine learning to identify potential loans at risk and take action. To tackle the problem we will train a Decision Tree Classifier with data available and use it to make predictions.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
